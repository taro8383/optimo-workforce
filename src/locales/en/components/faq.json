        "question": "How fast do I see savings?",
        "answer": "Within 30 days, you'll slash labor costs by 20-23% (87% of our customers do). Why? Because our AI doesn't need weeks to 'learn' your business—it starts optimizing the moment you connect your POS. That's real money back in your pocket before your next rent payment is due.",

        "question": "Do you work with my POS?",
        "answer": "If you're using Toast, Clover, Lightspeed, or Clip—you're already compatible. But here's the thing: we add new integrations every single week based on what restaurants actually need. Got a different system? Just ask. Chances are, we're already building it.",

      "q4": {
        "question": "Do I need to train my staff?",
        "answer": "Zero training. Your team won't even know we're there. They just show up to their (perfectly optimized) shifts, serve happy customers during (perfectly predicted) rush times, and go home without the chaos of understaffing. The AI handles the complexity so your team can focus on what they do best."
