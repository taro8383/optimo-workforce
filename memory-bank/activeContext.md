## Recent Changes (Internal)
1. **IntegrationsPage Features Fix**
   - Fixed TypeError when integration.features is not an array
   - Implemented robust handling for features data:
     - Handles cases where features might be array, string, or other type
     - Uses IIFEs to cleanly manage the logic
     - Ensures we always work with an array of strings
     - Maintains TypeScript type safety
   - Changes made in two locations:
     - Popular integrations section (shows first 4 features)
