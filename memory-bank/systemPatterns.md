# System Patterns: Optimo Workforce

## Architecture
- Single Page Application (SPA) with multiple views
- Component-based UI architecture
- State-driven page rendering

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Vite** chosen for fast development builds
2. **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling
3. **TypeScript** for type safety
4. **React hooks** for state management

## Component Structure
- Layout components (Header, Footer)
- Marketing sections (Hero, Pricing, etc.)
- Industry-specific pages (Restaurants, Hotels, Cafes)
- Utility pages (ROI Calculator, FAQ)

## Design Patterns
- Custom animations (fade-in, slide-up)
- Responsive grid layouts
- Gradient backgrounds
- Card-based content presentation
